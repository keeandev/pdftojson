# PDF to JSON API

This is a simple utility API that converts PDFs to structured JSON objects.

```json
{
  "total": 2,
  "pages": [
    "Page one contents....\nSecond line contents...",
    "Page two contents....\nSecond line contents..."
  ]
}
```

## Extra Goodies

<div>ðŸ“¦ Requests are cached with <a href="">Upstash</a> (10k commands/day)</div>
